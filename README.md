# spring-boot-file-crud-operations-with-mysql-postgresql
In this Spring Boot project I will perform CRUD operation on file where I can upload, download, edit and delete files using rest endpoints. I used Postman for API testing. These CRUD APIs can be integrated with any frontend WEB or Mobile app such as Angular, React.js, Vue.js, Flutter, Android, iOS etc.
